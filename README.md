# **Faculty and Course Management System**
## **Overview**
This project is a simple yet effective Faculty and Course Management System built using Python, leveraging the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to manage courses, faculty members, and salary adjustments based on teaching workload.

The system is a command-line application that showcases OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and object interaction. It's perfect for educational settings or administrative tasks, offering a hands-on way to practice and learn Python's OOP features.

## **Features**
### **Course Management:**

Display a list of all available courses.
**Faculty Management:**
Add new faculty members with basic information like name and monthly salary. \
